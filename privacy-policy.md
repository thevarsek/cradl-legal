# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 10, 2026**

NanthAI ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Cradl mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
When you use Cradl, you may provide:
- **Baby Information**: Name, date of birth, and tracking preferences
- **Event Data**: Feeding times, diaper changes, sleep patterns, medications, growth measurements, and notes
- **Custom Reminders**: Names and schedules for custom reminders you create

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Device Information**: Device type and operating system version (for app functionality only)
- **Subscription Status**: To verify your access to the App

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do **not** collect analytics or usage tracking data
- We do **not** use advertising identifiers
- We do **not** sell your data
- We do **not** collect location data
- We do **not** collect contact information beyond what you voluntarily enter

## How We Use Your Information

Your data is used solely to:
- Provide the App's core functionality (tracking, reminders, insights)
- Sync your data across your devices via iCloud
- Share data with caregivers you explicitly invite via Family Sharing
- Generate AI insights when you opt in to AI features

## Data Storage & Security

### Local Storage
All your data is stored locally on your device in an encrypted database.

### iCloud Sync
If you enable iCloud sync:
- Your data is synced to your personal iCloud account
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- We cannot access your iCloud data
- Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policy apply

### Family Sharing
If you share access with family members:
- Only family members in your iCloud Family Sharing group can be invited
- Shared data is transmitted via Apple's CloudKit sharing infrastructure
- You can revoke access at any time

## Data Retention

- Your data remains on your device until you delete it
- If you delete the App, local data is removed
- iCloud data can be managed through your iCloud settings
- You can export your data as CSV at any time from the App

## Children's Privacy

Cradl is designed for parents and caregivers to track infant care. The App does not collect personal information from children. All data entered is provided by adult users about their infants.

## Third-Party Services

### Apple Services
Cradl uses the following Apple services:
- **iCloud/CloudKit**: For data sync (governed by Apple's privacy policy)
- **StoreKit**: For subscription management (governed by Apple's privacy policy)
- **Siri/App Intents**: For voice commands (processed on-device)

### AI Features
The App includes optional AI-powered insights provided through OpenAI, L.L.C. ("OpenAI"):
- We ask for your permission in the app before AI features send data to OpenAI
- When AI features are enabled, we send the data needed to generate summaries and insights, which may include baby profile details, logged events (feeding, sleep, diaper, medication, and growth), notes, and related timestamps
- You can disable AI features at any time in app Settings to stop future sharing for AI summaries
- We require third-party providers that process data on our behalf to provide protections that are the same as or stronger than those described in this policy
- OpenAI's privacy policy is available at: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Access** your data (via the App or CSV export)
- **Delete** your data (delete events, babies, or the entire App)
- **Opt-out** of iCloud sync (use the App in local-only mode)
- **Withdraw consent** for AI processing at any time in app Settings
- **Revoke** caregiver sharing at any time

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the App or via the App Store update notes.
